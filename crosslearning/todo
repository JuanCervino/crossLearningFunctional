 - Normalize before hand
 - Error as a percentage - normalize per population
 - CL should be better than both centralized/independent 
    - Interpret the constraint values
    - Take 4 weeks
 - Functional is wrong
 - Get objective function -> test/train [sum of all countries]\

 - check the parametric projection
 - Check that lambdas converge in functional and constraints are satisfied
   - Increase the dual eta update - functional
